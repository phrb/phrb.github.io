I'm    a    Ph.D.     student    on   High-Performance    Computing    at    the
[POLARIS](https://team.inria.fr/polaris/)         Inria          Team         at
[LIG](https://www.liglab.fr/).   I'm  enrolled at  the  Ph.D.   programs of  the
University  of Grenoble  Alpes,  France, and  of the  University  of SÃ£o  Paulo,
Brazil.   My advisors  are [Alfredo  Goldman](https://www.ime.usp.br/~gold/new/)
and [Arnaud Legrand](http://mescal.imag.fr/membres/arnaud.legrand/).

My research interests are automatic  performance measurement and tuning for High
Performance Computing, using machine learning,  search heuristics, and design of
experiments.
