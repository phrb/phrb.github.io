I obtained my  PhD on Computer Science from the  Universities of Grenoble Alpes,
France,   and   of    São   Paulo,   Brazil.    My    advisors   were   [Alfredo
Goldman](https://www.ime.usp.br/~gold/new/)              and             [Arnaud
Legrand](http://mescal.imag.fr/membres/arnaud.legrand/), and  I worked  with the
[POLARIS](https://team.inria.fr/polaris/)         Inria          Team         at
[LIG](https://www.liglab.fr/) and the  [CCSL](https://ccsl.ime.usp.br/en) at the
University of São Paulo.

My research interests are automatic  performance measurement and tuning for High
Performance Computing, using machine learning,  search heuristics, and design of
experiments.

My PhD defense was
[recorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvfPalv1cq0), and you can also check the
[complete thesis](https://github.com/phrb/thesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf),
the [slides](https://github.com/phrb/thesis/blob/master/slides/presentation.pdf),
and the [git repository](https://github.com/phrb/thesis).
